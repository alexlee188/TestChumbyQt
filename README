Before you can run TestChumbyQt on the Insignia Infocast 3, you need to set up
the cross compile tool chain, the touch screen library (tslib), and Qt library
according to the instructions:

http://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2011/03/chumby-one-cross-compiler-qt/

You can then copy the TestChumbyQt binary to the Insignia Infocast by:

$ scp TestChumbyQt root@your_chumby_ip_address:/mnt/storage

Also copy the setup_paths (part of this git repo) script over:

$ scp setup_tslib root@your_chumby_ip_address:/mnt/storage

Now ssh into root@your_chumby_ip_address, and

$ cd /mnt/storage
$ /usr/chumby/script/stop_control_panel
$ source setup_paths
$ ./TestChumbyQt -qws -display :1

There is another script in this repo:  chumby-swap.sh

This script sets up a 256M swap file to have more virtual memory for running large programs, such as GCC.
